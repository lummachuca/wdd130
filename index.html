            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello my name is Lourdes Machuca." width="200">
            <p>I'm from Argentina, living in Buenos Aires and I am 26 years old, I served a mission during the
                pandemy
                and was
                amazing. I enjoy to spend time with my husband and friends and drink mate as picture shows!.I like
                new
                challenges
                and learn of them. <strong>I've embracing the programming</strong> because we could create almost
                any
                thing that we
                would love to see on any website, we could improve our imagination and explore our nature explorer.
                I
                will study the
                full carreer of programming, until I finish the Bachelor I won't stop.
                Please reach me out if you need help, I'm willing to help people towards I learn new things, this is
                a
                key of
                learning, whereas you teach something that you learned, your understanding will be better. One of
                the
                thing that I
                get used to do is use the Pomodoro's technic in Youtube, If you are strugglin with your study, this
                is a
                good
                technic.</p>
